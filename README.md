# Focally

A personal project created to get a better understanding of how Bootstrap works, the website itself is for a theoretical company that does web design. During site production I opted for use of a less generic design style with very minimum white space, overlaying many elements in an attempt to create an inner connected look.

## Features

* A basic 3 page design
* Google Forms Integration
* Bootstrap Framework
